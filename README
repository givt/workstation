There are a few dirs containing dot files for several programs:

    * bash
    * git
    * rss
    * vim

Another stuff that I use occasionally:

    * bin contains various scrits. see bin/README
    * doc contains various documents, such as 
      guidelines, tips, howtos, etc.

    * READE - this file 

Howto install/update:
