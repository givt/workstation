Often I use this repo to sync my work computers.

There are a few dirs containing dot files for several programs:

    * bash
    * git
    * rss
    * vim
    * xkb

Another stuff that I use occasionally:

    * bin contains various scrits. see bin/README
    * doc contains various documents, such as 
      guidelines, tips, howtos, etc.

    * READE - this file 

Howto install/update:
    
    * Makefile:

    $ make install # use verbose to more output
    $ make update  # actually git pull

    read more INSTALL
